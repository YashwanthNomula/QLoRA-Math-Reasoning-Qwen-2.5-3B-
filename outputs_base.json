    "model_output": "### Instruction:\nExplain the power rule\n\n### Response:\nThe power rule is a fundamental concept in calculus that provides a method for finding the derivative of a function that has been raised to a power. It states that if you have a function of the form f(x) = x^n, where n is any real number, then the derivative of this function with respect to x is given by:\n\nf'(x) = nx^(n-1)\n\nIn simpler terms, the power rule tells us that to find the derivative of a function raised to a power, we can multiply the exponent (n) by the original function (x^n), and then subtract one from the exponent. \n\nFor example, let's say we want to find the derivative of the function f(x) = x^3. Using the power rule, we would multiply 3 by x^3 and then subtract 1 from the exponent, resulting in:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^(3-1) = 3x^2\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = x^3 is f'(x) = 3x^2.\n\nIt's important to note that the power rule only applies when the exponent is a constant. If the exponent is a variable or a function of x, then the power rule cannot be directly applied, and other methods must be used to find the derivative. Additionally, the power rule does not apply to functions that are not raised to a power, such as trigonometric functions or exponential functions. In those cases,"

It states that if you have a function f(x) = u(x) * v(x), where u(x) and v(x) are differentiable functions, then the derivative of f(x) with respect to x can be found using the following formula:\n\nf'(x) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)\n\nIn simpler terms, the product rule tells us that the derivative of a product of two functions is equal to the first function times the derivative of the second function plus the second function times the derivative of the first function.\n\nFor example, let's say we have a function f(x) = x^2 * sin(x). To find the derivative of this function, we can use the product rule. Let u(x) = x^2 and v(x) = sin(x). Then, we have:\n\nu'(x) = 2x\nv'(x) = cos(x)\n\nUsing the product rule, we get:\n\nf'(x) = (2x)(sin(x)) + (x^2)(cos(x))\n\nThis means that the derivative of f(x) = x^2 * sin(x) is f'(x) = 2x * sin(x) + x^2 * cos(x).\n\nThe product rule is widely used in various fields such as physics, engineering, and economics, among others,"
